# JavaMath

This project aims to make several math tools using Java.
Currently, I plan to have tools for statistics, matrices,
and also general math tools, such as a factorial function. 
This list as well as its contents are likely to grow in the 
future. To account for this, there will be READMEs inside 
each of the packages going into more detail on how to use them.
